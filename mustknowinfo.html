      <UL>
      <LI>All about asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers</LI>
          <UL>
          <LI>Experts estimate that every person with COVID-19 will go on to infect around 2.2 - 2.7 other people.</LI>
          <LI> Research suggests that presymptomatic and asymptomatic carriers and patients could be</LI> responsible for over 50% of transmissions.
          <LI>The same article claimed that at least one-third of unseen infections must be isolated in order to successfully limit an outbreak to</LI> affecting less than 1% of the population.
          <LI>According to the CDC, it takes 2-14 days after exposure for symptoms of COVID-19 to show. During this time, the infected person could unknowingly infect others.</LI>
          <LI>Current evidence suggests that people with mild to moderate symptoms can remain infectious up to 10 days after those symptoms first appear. Severely infected patients have the potential to spread the disease up to 20 days after their first symptoms appear.</LI>
          <LI>If you have no symptoms but tested positive for COVID-19, you may stop isolating after 10 days if and only if no more symptoms develop.</LI>

        <li>Why you should wear a mask - Tackling Anti-mask Arguments
      </li>
          <ul>
            <li>“There is little to no evidence that masks work.”</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The coronavirus is spread via respiratory droplets that come out when a carrier sneezes, coughs, speaks, or raises their voice. Multiple studies and recommendations by the CDC have proven that wearing a mask keeps the wearer from spreading these droplets to other people.
      </li> 

              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <ul> 
        <li>“Viral particles can pass through the pores within the mask, therefore masks are useless.”</li>
        <li>“But I’m American! I have the right to wear a mask if I don’t want to! Making us wear masks is taking away my freedom.”</li>
        <ul> 
          <li>The notion of not wearing a face mask is not a constitutional right. There is no explicit indication in the U.S. Constitution that states an individual can refuse to wear a face mask. 
          <li>In fact, it can be argued that wearing a face mask is unconstitutional because not wearing a mask increases the risk of those around you contracting the virus in the event that the refuser is a carrier of COVID-19, therefore breaching the right to life (from “life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness”) for those in contact with you.
      


        </ul>
        <li>“Masks are too uncomfortable! I can’t breathe in one/it reduces my oxygen supply.”</li>
        <ul>
          <li>While masks do reduce the amount of oxygen an individual can take in by approximately 20%, the pros of wearing the mask (drastically reducing one’s risk of contracting the virus) greatly outweighs the pros of not wearing the mask (drastically increasing one’s risk of contracting the virus).
          <li>Researchers at Stanford University are trying to emulate a mechanism similar to the electrochemical process of concentrating oxygen from regular air used by car manufacturers for face masks.  

      </ul>
        <li>Healthcare workers on the frontline of the pandemic wear different masks. Why are we wearing cheap pieces of cloth instead of those?</li>
        <ul> 
          <li>There aren’t enough of these types of masks to go around. Overbuying them for use by the general public would put healthcare workers at risk.</li>
          <li>The more effective masks and PPE must be limited to people on the frontline because those are the people who are most exposed to the virus and the case where it is most important that the wearer be protected. These masks tend to filter the environment so well that they require a valve so that the wearer can breathe. This valve does not protect the environment from the wearer, however, because the virus can still be spread through it.</li>
          <li>The cloth masks worn by the general public are different. They’re used for the same reason that covering your mouth when you cough is. To protect other people.</li>
          <li>Cloth face masks are made to intercept the respiratory droplets and keep them from spreading into your environment when you cough, sneeze, or talk to other people. It’s safer for everyone if the droplets stay on the inside of your mask rather than on someone else or on a surface that someone else will touch.</li>
      </ul>
      <li> “If other peoples’ masks really work, I shouldn’t have to wear one.”
      <li>“I shouldn’t have to wear a mask to protect others. I’m young and healthy. People who are vulnerable or sick should just stay in quarantine while the healthy people go out.”
      <ul>
      <li>Vice President Mike Pence announced last month that approximately half of the new cases are from adults under 35. One can still be “healthy” but spread the virus to someone who isn’t as “healthy” and that person can suffer because he/she has a weaker immune system than the adult under 35.
      <li>Perfectly healthy people can carry COVID-19 and show no symptoms while still spreading it. You might be a carrier without even realizing it, and without a mask, you could easily spread it to someone who is more vulnerable or someone who will end up in contact with someone vulnerable to COVID-19.
      <li>Again, as stated by researchers, compliance needs to be universal or near-universal in order to successfully limit the spread of the virus.
      <li>Although we were told at the beginning that COVID-19 is only really serious for older people, evidence has risen to prove that people of all ages - including children and young adults - can be infected to the point of hospitalization or even become critically ill.
      <li>Young and perfectly healthy people can still be severely infected or die from COVID-19. One notable case is a 22-year-old woman who died from COVID-19, serving as proof that young people are not immune to infection, severe complications, or death.
      <li>A study by the University of California, San Francisco suggests that ⅓ of young adults are vulnerable to severe symptoms of COVID-19. If you smoke, you are vulnerable to COVID-19 despite your age.
      </ul>
      <li>“I recently tested negative for COVID-19. I shouldn’t have to worry about wearing a mask.”
      <ul>
      <li>The incubation period for COVID-19 (aka the time it takes from contacting the virus to showing symptoms) can be as long as 2 weeks. You could still be in the incubation period from having contracted the virus prior to being tested, or you could’ve contracted the virus after being tested and you are still in the incubation period.
      <li>By not wearing a mask, you also increase your chances of getting the virus since there’s zero blockage between you and the particles.
      </ul> </ul>
      <li> Common Myths About COVID-19
        <ul>
        <li> “COVID-19 was artificially created in a Chinese lab.”
      <ul>
      <li>There’s some new evidence that’s showing that the virus has long-lasting, if not, permanent, effects on one’s cardiovascular and respiratory abilities.</ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      <li>“The economy is reopening, so we shouldn’t have to worry about the virus anymore.”
      <ul>
      <li>There is going to be more physical contact/ lack of social distancing, so the virus is likely to spread even faster.
      </ul>
      <li>“COVID-19 was artificially created in a Chinese lab.”
      <ul>
      <li>Where the virus came from doesn’t matter. It is something that is out of our control. We should instead focus on matters that we have control over, such as keeping 2 meters (approximately 6 feet) apart from people, and wearing face masks when in public.
